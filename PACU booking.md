# Standard Operating Procedure for booking a PACU bed
UCLH Critical Care
Version 2018-03-03v2

> This should show up in the couchDB as a new version

# Justification

All patients who require admission to the Post Anaesthetic Care Unit on T03 – Intensive Care Unit following their operation/procedure must be booked. This allows for planning of staffing, capacity and consumables to occur.

# Procedures

## Booking a PACU bed

1.  All booking requests must be sent to
	**uclh.pacubedbooking@nhs.net** at least **three** working days in
	advance.
2.  A PACU booking form is available on Insight UCLH Intranet under
	Forms Tab. Please type *PACU*.
3.  Information team will review all requests once per day between 8am
	and 10am.
4.  Urgent requests for a bed within the next **three** working days
	**must** be 
	- accompanied by a telephone call to extension 73358
	**and** an emailed booking form.
	- **agreed by the critical care consultant responsible for admissions on the day of booking (i.e. that day, not the day of surgery) **
5.  Complete forms with all the relevant information will be booked onto
	-   PACU booking register (an Excel sheet on shared drive, copies
		available on request)
	-   ICU whiteboard
6.  A confirmation email will be returned to the following people
	acknowledge receipt and confirming that a booking has been made.
	Confirmation of a booking is **not** confirmation of a bed. Bed
	availability will always depend on clinical capacity, and be
	prioritised by clinical need.
7.  To confirm PACU bed availability all teams are required to contact
	PACU co-ordinator on 07908 617 681 (alternatively NIC on 07736 330
	331) on the morning of a planned surgery/procedure.
8.  All teams are required to inform PACUbedbookings in regards to
	cancellations and/ or changes to the TCI date of patient’s surgery.
9.  The PACU booking team will maintain the master list of bookings
	which can then be used to update other systems (theatre lists
	\[Opera\], EPR, etc.). A copy of the master list is available on
	request.

## Incomplete bookings

1.  The incomplete booking will be logged.
2.  The email will be returned to the sender with the pro forma text
	below. Where possible, we will endeavour to also inform the relevant
	Consultant and Service manager too (but this will depend on there
	being sufficient information on the form).

## Internal checks

1.  Information team to cross check PACU bookings received with Theatre
	lists and Opera for the following day - @ 1pm Monday to Friday.
2.  Information team to send an email with PACU bookings confirmed and
	queries for the following 7 days to “PACU bookings recipient list”
	(including Bed Managers, Performance managers, Service managers, ICU
	Ward Administrators, Theatre staff etc.)
3.  Information team to run a quick update in the afternoon (c. 4.45pm)
	of any changes to PACU bookings (late bookings/ cancellations) for
	the following day, and amend the PACU booking list.
